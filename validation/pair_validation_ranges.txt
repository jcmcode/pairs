PAIR VALIDATION OUTPUT GUIDE 

  -------------------------------------------------
  1) CLUSTER PERSISTENCE (0 to 1)
  -------------------------------------------------
  Represents how long the two stocks have
  stayed in the same cluster recently.

  0.8 – 1.0 = STRONG temporary relationship (what we want)
  0.6 – 0.8 = OK 
  < 0.6 = WEAK relationship

  The higher the value, the better.
  -------------------------------------------------
  2) LAG-1 AUTOCORRELATION
  -------------------------------------------------
  Represents if the spread keeps moving in the same direction.

  Negative = STRONG mean reversion (what we want)
  -0.2 to 0.2 = neutral/not trending
  0.2 to 0.6 = OK 
  > 0.7 =  trending, NOT reverting (do NOT want)

  We want either a low value, or a negative which is even better.
  -------------------------------------------------
  3) AR(1) PHI (Mean-Reversion Strength)
  -------------------------------------------------
  Represents how related the spread is to its previous value.

  < 0 = VERY STRONG mean reversion
  0.0 – 0.4 = STRONG mean reversion 
  0.4 – 0.6 = GOOD 
  0.6 – 0.75 = WEAK 
  > 0.8 = BAD (trend-like behavior) 
  ≈ 1.0 = NO mean reversion

  We want LOWER phi values.
  -------------------------------------------------
  4) BOUNCE RATE (0 to 1)
  -------------------------------------------------
  Represents how often the spread pulls back after becoming extreme.

  0.6 – 1.0 = VERY GOOD 
  0.4 – 0.6 = GOOD 
  0.2 – 0.4 = WEAK
  < 0.2 = BAD

  We want high bounce rates.
